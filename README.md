ðŸ“Œ Featured Projects
Here are some of the key projects I have worked on:

1. Taxi-Fare-Predictor-AutomatiData
- ðŸ”¹ Overview: The goal of this project is to create a multiple linear regression model to predict ride fares based on multiple variables. This project utilized yellow taxi trips taken -in New York City during 2017. The final multiple linear regression model performed with R^2 of 0.868 indicating 86.8% variance being explained by the model.
- ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn , Multiple Linear Regression


2. Claim-Opinion-Classifier-TikTok
- ðŸ”¹ Overview: The goal of this project was to create a random forest model and XGBoost to classify TikTok videos as claims of opinions. This project utilized a synthetic dataset created in association with TikTok. A data dictionary has been added to assist in the understanding to the dataset. The final random forest model performed with 99.5% Recall . Performance on the test holdout data yielded near perfect scores, with only five misclassified samples out of 3,817 . Also determined what features were most important in separating claims and opinions. Based on the model, video view count , video like count and video share count were the most influential in determining a video to be a claim or an opinion.
